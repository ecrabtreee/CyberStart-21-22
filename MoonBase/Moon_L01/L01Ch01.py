# Briefing L01 C01
# Programming 101
# Good morning agent, welcome to your first day of training on the Moon Base. Our goal on this level is to teach you some programming basics. We use a programming language called Python at the CPA and today we're going to start with a simple task - teaching you a few simple things like code comments and using the print function.
# We have an interactive code editor for you to learn on, the CPA MoonCoder. Simply change the code in the editor on the left side and click the green "Submit code" button to make it run. You'll then see the output of your code (along with a flag to submit if you get it correct) on the right side.
# And don't forget, if you get stuck you can click "Use a hint". Whilst you're in training you won't lose any points for doing so.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This is a code comment
# Anything with a '#' before it is considered a comment and ignored.
# You can use these for writing notes about what your code is doing.
# This is so you can understand it more easily if you
# come back to it after some time.

# In Python, you can output text to the screen using the print function.
# The function is print("text")

print("text")

# You can also print numbers out. With numbers, you don't have to
# put them in quotation marks.

print(42)

# CHALLENGE 1: First print out the text: Hello, World

# CHALLENGE 2: Next print out the numbers: 1337

# SOLUTION

# CHALLENGE 1: First print out the text: Hello, World
print("Hello, World")
# CHALLENGE 2: Next print out the numbers: 1337
